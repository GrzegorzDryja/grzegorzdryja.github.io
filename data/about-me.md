# Hello World! {about}
My name is Grzegorz [Gregory]. First contact with developing I had in 2004, when I have to make online photogallery in my first job. It was PHP script downloaded from web. Then as a skateboard veteran I've done some www for local skate contest (html, css only). I had some skill to do this so in next job I've configured by my own online shop from ZEN Cart sciprts. That was the time when I known the web was bild as a table and PHP rules the world. Nothing excaiting. At this point I didn't feel that programming is the way for my career.  
Finished economy stydies, and for over a decade I've worked as an e-commerce sales specialist. But IT was always near to my duties: www, online-shop, SQL, ERP administartor. I was the dude to make things working with all tech stuff in office.  
2015 was my breakpoint. I've started passionate about coding, lot's of free time I was spending on online courses, start reading IT webs and books, went for IT conferences.  
Now progressing my codding skills in full-time and searching for my next job, of course most willingly in IT.  
Ready to work remotly from Radom, I've got some nice office to work from here. But 100 km is no problem for me - Warsaw, Kielce, Krakow, Lodz.  
Privtely: father of two lovely doughters, skier, saveing money for first gravel bike, waiting for next trip... Mountains are calling.
