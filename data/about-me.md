# Hello World!  
My name is Grzegorz. Self-learning developer, excited about useing TypeScript in both: front- and back-end. Practiced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and a really, really little bit of C# in small exercises. Around tech since 2004.

I had my first contact with IT dutie in 2004 when I had to make an online photogallery in my first job. It was a PHP script downloaded from web. Then, as a skateboard veteran I did some www for the local skate contest (html, CSS). I had some skill to do this so in my next job I configured an online shop from ZEN Cart sciprts. In 2013 my Allegro's (biggest sales platform in Poland) template was honored at the Allegro training for e-commerce. That was the time when I knew how to build html pages as a table and I thought PHP rules the world. Nothing exciting. At this point I didn't feel that programming was the way for my career.  

I finished studies in economics, and for over a decade I worked as an e-commerce sales specialist. But IT has always been near to my duties: www, online-shop, SQL, ERP administrator. I was always the dude to make things work with all tech stuff in office.  

2015 was my breakpoint. I started to believe that I could be indeed excellent programmer. I was spending a good deal of time on online courses (udemy.com, strefakursow.pl), SoloLearn app, started reading IT webs, podcasts and books, attended IT conferences.

Now progressing my coding skills in full-time mostly working with Deno runtime, practicing modularized, OOP programming with TypeScript, but Node.js is around to. Searching for my next job, of course most willingly in IT. 

Ready to work remotly from Radom, I've got some nice office to work from here. But +100 km is no problem for me - Warsaw, Kielce, Krakow, Lodz.

Privtely: family man, skier, saving money for my first gravel bike, waiting for next trip... Mountains are calling
