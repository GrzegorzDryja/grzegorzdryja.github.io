# Hello World!  
My name is Grzegorz. I had my first contact with developing in 2004 when I had to make an  online  photogallery in my first job. It was a PHP script downloaded from web. Then, as a skateboard veteran I did some www for the local skate contest (html, CSS). I had some skill to do this so in my next job I configured an online shop from ZEN Cart sciprts. In 2013 my Allegro's (biggest sales platform in Poland) template was honored at the Allegro training for e-commerce. That was the time when I knew how to build html pages as a table and I thought PHP rules the world. Nothing exciting. At this point I didn't feel that programming was the way for my career.  

I finished studies in economics, and for over a decade I worked as an e-commerce sales specialist. But IT has always been near to my duties: www, online-shop, SQL, ERP administrator. I was the dude to make things work with all tech stuff in office.  

2015 was my breakpoint. I started to believe that I could be really good at programming. I was spending a good deal of time on online courses, started reading IT webs, podcasts and books, attended IT conferences. Now progressing my coding skills in full-time and searching for my next job, of course most willingly in IT. 

Ready to work remotly from Radom, I've got some nice office to work from here. But 100 km is no problem for me - Warsaw, Kielce, Krakow, Lodz.  

Privtely: family man, skier, saving money for my first gravel bike, waiting for next trip... Mountains are calling
